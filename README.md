- The View from Kansas


Hi! Welcome to my website. I’m an avid learner and professional based in Kansas and I’ve just launched my writing career. With a unique mix of art, human resources (SHRM-SCP certified), education, higher ed and research administration in my background, I pull from a variety of experiences to create thoughtful, succinct content for my clients. 

A few of my favorite experiences include mentoring pre-service art teachers as they led children’s art classes at the Spencer Museum of Art, helping my team navigate tough hurdles and emerge stronger, and building relationships with a wide variety of people across the University and beyond. My first job out of undergrad was a newspaper reporter for a weekly newspaper in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. I wrote about everything from the Fourth of July parade to the latest scandal on the school board. I even won a few awards for my troubles. You can find the details of my career on my resume [link to resume]. 

Watch for more in my fiction section. As a side hustle to my side hustle, I’m working on a mystery novel whose protagonist is a curator at a small liberal arts college with a go-fuck-yourself attitude. As you may imagine, that doesn’t always work out well for her. 

I live with my husband and two-year-old son in a 1950s ranch house in Overland Park, Kansas. Occasionally I like to dress the part of 1950s fit-and-flare housewife or 1960s liberated mama. Just depends on my mood.
